This week we spent a lot of time deciding exactly how we wanted to implement the "tennis ball shooter" design we wish to implement. The idea is that we will somehow spin up a motor that will give the quaffles enough momentum to get shot into the goals. But the issue is how we will feed the quaffles into this system.

Some ideas were suggested, such as building a small-scale vacuum that would suck the quaffles up. The problem here is getting the quaffles out of the vacuum collection chamber and into this shooter system. Ultimately, we were too concerned with the power drainage that such a vacuum would contribute to our robot.

We decided that some sort of ramp system would be the optimal way of getting the quaffles into the shooting system. Much like Yellow Team, we decided that a roller of some kind would be the easiest way to guide the quaffles up the ramp, because it is very much likely that the balls would not roll up the ramp easily since they're incredibly light. We proposed a few ideas and built a small-scale foamcore model of this system, and it seemed to do the job, so we will proceed with this idea.

We also built a small-scale model of the shooter system using a tube built out of foamcore, and it seemed to work. We are currently printing out a tube to test if this idea will actually work in practice.

Travers, John, Thomas, and Michael all contributed to the theorycrafting.

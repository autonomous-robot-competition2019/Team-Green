This week, we finished the remaining milestones and began modeling our robot's chassis in 3D. 

Travers worked on completing milestones 8 and 9. The code is practically the same as the code for milestone 7, which is in our journal entry from a few weeks ago. This code generalized well to finding quaffles and the snitch consistently. We will probably use this logic when seeking quaffles and goals when we build our robot.

Michael and John worked on modeling the chassis in 3D. John began printing out part of the body, and we hope to have it completed by next Monday so we can implement the code Travers wrote and integrate it into a larger quaffle-seeking strategy. 

Thomas unfortunately could not make it to lab, but he has been instrumental in helping John print out the robot chassis.

Last class we continued to work on completing checkpoints for the course. We worked on creating a goalie. We did so by having the robot move horizontally across the pitch. The pixyCam was mounted horizontally to the bodyomand looked for quaffles to the front left and right and reacted accordingly. 

Thomas also continued on building the 3D model for our final robot frame. In addition we started designing our quaffle shooter, which consists of two fast dc motors with fast discs attached on top
